* Introduction
** Introduction of myself: 
+ former Sciences Po student
+ *economist* at Banque de France. 

** Introduction of the class
1. core notions of quantitative research for the social sciences: 
   + review essential *statistical concepts*

   + *regression analysis*
2. do all of this in *Stata*.

** Course logistics
+ Elect a student representative
** Assignments
+ Hands-on focus
+ Open-assignment: one small-scale research project developped throughout the course
+ Pre-existing data, cross-sectional data and continuous data.
+ Work by pairs.
+ 10,12 pages (a paper + code)
*** Research design
    

** Introduction of students
Tell a bit about yourself:
1. what have you done before Sciences Po
2. in which major are you graduating
3. Your level in statistics and programming
 

* Week 1 - Introduction
** Statistics
*** Different kind of variables
+ *qualitative* variables : qualitative attribute such as hair color, eye color, 
religion, gender. Qualitative variables can be split in two subcategories: 
    - ordered (sometimes referred as *ordinal*): educational experience

    Some examples of quantitative variables are height, weight, and shoe size.
*** Main statistics
**** Main statistics

*** Stata Interface
5 docked windows : 

| Windows    | Description                                 |
|------------+---------------------------------------------|
| Command    | where you type your commands                |
| Results    | where Stata will display results            |
| Review     | History of commands                         |
| Variables  | List variables in the dataset               |
| Properties | display properties of variables and dataset |
|------------+---------------------------------------------|

Other windows (see when needed)
+ Graph
+ Viewer
+ Variable manages
+ Data editor
+ Do file editor

*** Typing commands
+ with command `display`, Stata can work as a calculator

Most Stata command same the share syntax.
>   command variable [, options]

*** Getting help
Stata has an excellent online help. Ask help with:
>   help /command_name/

Display help in the command line with 
>   chelp /command_name/

*** Loading a Sample Data File
Stata comes with a few sample data files. 
Have a complete list with 
>   sysuse dir

One of them is lifeexp.dta, which has data on life expectancy and gross national
product (GNP) per capita in 1998 for 68 countries
>   sysuse lifeexp, clear 
*** Descriptive Statistics
>   summarize lexp gnppc
>   su lexp gnppc, details
