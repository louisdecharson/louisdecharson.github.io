    <h2>Lecture 1 - Exercise in class</h2>

    
    <p>John is earning $10k. His income increases to 20k the first year, then decreases by 20% the second year and increases by 10% the third year. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="q">1. By how much has John's income increased the first year?</p>
        <div class="ans"><p>John income has increased by:
        \[
        \frac{20,000-10,000}{10,000} = 1
        \]
        John's income has increased by <strong>100%</strong>. </p><p><i>Note that multiplying by two a variable is the same as increasing the variable by 100%</i></p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="q">2. What is John's income at the end of the third year?</p>
        <div class="ans">
          <p>At the end of the end of the third year John income is:</p>
          \[20,000*(1-\frac{20}{100})*(1+\frac{10}{100}) = 17,600\]
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="q">3. Compute the average growth rate.</p>
        <div class="ans">
          <p>Over the three years, John income has been multiplied by:
          \[\frac{17,600}{10,000} = 1.76\]
          </p>
          <p>Thus, the multiplying factor is 1.76, and we use the formula for the average growth rate:</p>
          \[(1.76)^{\frac{1}{3}}-1 = 0.2073\]
          <p>On average, John's income has increased by <strong>20.73%</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="q">4. The taxes are progressive according to the table below. Compute the amount of taxes paid by John the third year.</p>
        <div class="ans">
          <p>We need to split the 17,600 of John between the four categories starting from the first. John earns more than 15k so he fills the first three categories, and the last 2.6k falls in the last category. Thus, John pays no tax for his first 5k. He pays 10% for the second 5k of his income, which equals $500. He pays 15% on the third 5k, which equals $750. John pays 25% of his last 2.6k: $650. Finally, John pays 500+750+650=<strong>$1900</strong> of taxes.</p>

      </li>
    <div style="width:50%!important;">
    <table class="table table-condensed">
      <thead>
        <th>0-5k</th>
        <th>5-10k</th>

        <th>+20k</th>

          <td>0%</td>
          <td>10%</td>
          <td>15%</td>
          <td>25%</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    <li>
      <p class="q">5. What should be the flat tax rate so that John pays the same amount of taxes?</p>
      <p class="ans">
        The flat tax rate should be:
        \[\frac{1,900}{17,600} = 10.80\%\]
      </p>
    </li>
